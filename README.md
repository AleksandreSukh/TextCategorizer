# TextCategorizer

Text Categorizer is a simple text type detector application. It can detect type of passed text based on pre-learnt data.
For example if you choose training data to be text files from categories like: Sport Article, Historical novel, Programming tutorial and you give it 10 texts for each category then application will be able to determine category of other texts. 

More categories and more data => more accurate results but slower evaluation.

This demo "knows" only three types of text (Medical,Law,Economics) and only in Georgian language but it can be easily extended to support other types of text and other languages by enriching its knowledge base with more text data. 

Code is commented in Georgian (because this was my university project) 

Usage sample can be found at Wiki page
